# Responsive Design & Cross-Browser Testing - Test Cases

This document outlines 30 detailed test cases designed to validate the responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility of a web application. These tests ensure that the application's layout, content, and interactive elements render and function correctly across various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) and popular browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera).

---
**Key Objectives:**
- Validate layout adaptability across different device widths using media queries.
- Ensure UI components behave consistently in modern browsers.
- Verify accessibility and usability on mobile and tablet devices.
- Identify any rendering or interaction issues due to browser-specific behavior.

These test cases are crucial for delivering a seamless user experience across platforms and preventing layout breaks, usability issues, or content misalignment.

## Conclusion

The above test cases provide a comprehensive approach to validating the responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility of a web application. Ensuring a consistent and seamless experience across different devices and browsers is essential to delivering high-quality, accessible software.

By executing these test cases, QA teams can identify layout inconsistencies, interaction issues, and device-specific bugs early in the development lifecycle. This contributes to better usability, higher user satisfaction, and reduced production issues.

For extended coverage, consider testing:
- On legacy browser versions if supported
- On real devices in addition to emulators
- For accessibility compliance (WCAG)
