# ðŸ§¾ User Profile Module - UI & Functional Test Suite

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive set of test cases for the **User Profile** module of a web application. The module enables users to view, update, and manage their personal information such as name, email, password, profile picture, and preferences.

The test suite is divided into two main categories:

- **UI Test Cases** â€“ These focus on verifying the visual presentation and responsiveness of UI elements such as input fields, labels, buttons, and layout across various screen sizes.
- **Functional Test Cases** â€“ These validate the underlying functionality of profile-related features including data updates, validations, file uploads, password changes, and session behavior.

Each test case includes a unique ID, description, step-by-step actions, expected result, and priority to aid in planning and execution.

> **Purpose:** Ensure the profile section of the application delivers a seamless, intuitive, and error-free user experience across both user interface and functional aspects.
