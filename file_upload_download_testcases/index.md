# File Upload & Download - Test Cases

This document outlines detailed test cases designed to validate the functionality, performance, and error handling of file upload and download features in a web application. These tests are essential to ensure that files can be uploaded and downloaded correctly, regardless of file type, size, or device.

**Key Testing Focus Areas:**
- **File Upload:** Verifying the handling of different file types, sizes, formats, and edge cases like empty or broken files.
- **File Download:** Ensuring smooth and error-free downloads, including support for various browsers and devices.
- **User Experience:** Ensuring ease of use when uploading or downloading files, including drag-and-drop, progress bars, and preview features.
- **Error Handling:** Testing for appropriate error messages when unsupported formats are uploaded, file size limits are exceeded, or file download links are broken.

The following test cases cover a wide range of scenarios to validate both the technical and user-facing aspects of file upload/download functionalities, ensuring a robust and seamless experience for the end user.
